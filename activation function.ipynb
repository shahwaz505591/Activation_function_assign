    "Q1. What is an activation function in the context of artificial neural networks?\n",
    "An activation function in the context of artificial neural networks is a mathematical operation applied to the output of each neuron in a neural network. It introduces non-linearity to the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data. The activation function determines whether a neuron should be activated (output a value) or not based on the input it receives.\n"

    "Activation functions play a crucial role in the training process of neural networks. They introduce non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex relationships in the data. The choice of activation function can impact the convergence speed during training, the ability to capture features in the data, and the network's overall performance.\n"
